Owns authentication, base URL construction,   request/response handling, and diagnostic state. Provides generated   command methods for all MQSC commands. A single session represents a   connection to one queue manager's REST API. Command methods ~144 generated MQSC command methods. Each method is a thin wrapper that   calls the internal command dispatcher with the correct command verb and   qualifier. Method names follow the pattern <code>verb_qualifier</code> (or   <code>verbQualifier</code> in camelCase languages), mapping directly to MQSC   commands. For example, <code>DISPLAY QUEUE</code> becomes <code>display_queue</code> /   <code>displayQueue</code>, and <code>DEFINE QLOCAL</code> becomes <code>define_qlocal</code> /   <code>defineQlocal</code>. Ensure methods 16 idempotent ensure methods for declarative object management. Each   method checks current state with DISPLAY, then DEFINE, ALTER, or no-ops   as needed. Returns an ensure result indicating what action was taken.   The queue manager variant is a special singleton (no name, no DEFINE).   Only changed attributes are sent in ALTER commands, preserving   <code>ALTDATE</code>/<code>ALTTIME</code> audit timestamps. Mapping pipeline Bidirectional attribute translation between developer-friendly names and   native MQSC parameter names. Includes key mapping (attribute names),   value mapping (enumerated values), and key-value mapping (combined   name+value translations). The mapping tables were bootstrapped from   IBM MQ 9.4 documentation and cover all standard MQSC attributes. Exception hierarchy Structured error types for transport failures, malformed responses,   authentication errors, MQSC command errors, and polling timeouts.

Each method is a thin wrapper that   calls the internal <code>mqscCommand()</code> dispatcher with the correct verb and   qualifier.</li> <li><code>attributeMapper</code>: Internal type that handles bidirectional attribute   translation using mapping data loaded from an embedded JSON resource. See   the mapping pipeline for details.</li> <li>Error types: Typed error structs (<code>TransportError</code>, <code>CommandError</code>, etc.)   used with <code>errors.As()</code>.
