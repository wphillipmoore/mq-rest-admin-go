# Release 1.1.9 (2026-02-21)

## CI

- **add gocyclo complexity gate to CI and local validation (#146)**
Wire gocyclo into CI workflow and validate_local.sh with a max complexity threshold of 15. Update repository-standards.md and CLAUDE.md to document the new check.


## Documentation

- **ban MEMORY.md usage in CLAUDE.md (#148)**
Add auto-memory policy requiring agents to discuss behavioral rules with the human rather than storing them in unmanaged MEMORY.md files.

- **ban heredocs in shell commands (#149)**
Add explicit ban on heredocs for multi-line CLI arguments. Always use temp files instead.


## Features

- **add category prefixes to job names (#147)**
Standardize job display names with category prefixes so checks cluster naturally in the GitHub status list.

- **adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture (#150)**
* feat(validate): adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture

Add primary_language: go to repo profile. Replace repo-specific validate_local.sh with synced driver and language-specific scripts from standard-tooling.
