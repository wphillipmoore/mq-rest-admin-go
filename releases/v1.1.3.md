# Release 1.1.3 (2026-02-16)

## Bug fixes

- **remove PR_BUMP_TOKEN and add issue linkage to bump PR (#66)**
Replace secrets.PR_BUMP_TOKEN with github.token (the PAT was removed).
Remove the git remote set-url hack since actions/checkout already
configures the token. Add self-referencing issue linkage to the bump
PR body with close/reopen to trigger CI with the updated body.
