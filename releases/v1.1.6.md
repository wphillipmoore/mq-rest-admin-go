## Features

- **add canonical local validation script (#104)**
Add scripts/dev/validate_local.sh that checks prerequisites (go,
golangci-lint, govulncheck) and runs all CI hard-gate checks as a single
fail-fast command. Update repository-standards.md with
canonical_local_validation_command and CLAUDE.md to reference the script.

- **add shared tooling sync from standard-tooling v1.0.0**
Sync all shared scripts from standard-tooling canonical source.
Adds lint scripts (commit-messages.sh, markdown-standards.sh,
pr-issue-linkage.sh, repo-profile.sh) and dev scripts
(finalize_repo.sh, sync-tooling.sh) not previously present.

- **apply gofmt -s simplifications for goreportcard.com compliance (#115)**
- **reduce mqscCommand cyclomatic complexity for goreportcard.com (#116)**
* feat: reduce mqscCommand cyclomatic complexity for goreportcard.com compliance

Extract three helper methods from mqscCommand to bring cyclomatic complexity
from 24 down to 6, well below the gocyclo threshold of 15.

- **add tools.go for development tool dependency management (#118)**
Pin govulncheck, go-test-coverage, and gocyclo in tools.go with
//go:build tools constraint. Update README.md and CLAUDE.md with
install instructions.
