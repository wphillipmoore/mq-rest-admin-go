## Bug fixes

- **remove duplicate CI runs and relax coverage threshold (#60)**
* fix: remove duplicate CI runs and relax coverage threshold

Remove release/** from push trigger to prevent duplicate workflow runs
when a release branch has an open PR. The pull_request trigger already
covers release branches.

Relax test coverage threshold from 100% to 99%. Go coverage tooling
has limitations that make 100% impractical without quality-hurting
workarounds.
